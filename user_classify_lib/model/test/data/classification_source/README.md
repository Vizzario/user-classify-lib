# Classification Source Files
Data generated by Sight Kit and Eyeliens applications prepared as input data for classification efforts.

## Normalized Data Files
Files starting with `normalized_data` and separated by study key have the following internal structure:

* Dictionary where each key is a unique User ID and the value is a dictionary with `demograhpics` and `normalized` keys
    * `demographics` contains on-boarding data (where available) from each user's initial interaction with the Sight Kit or Eyeliens application
    * `normalized` contains many psychophysical measure and VPI score values averaged from all game rounds of all games (when those games or rounds happened to generate that value)
        * The averaged, normalized values are within the range [55, 145] and each have an approximate distribution mean and standard deviation of 100 and 15, respectively (whether they are part of VPI or not)
